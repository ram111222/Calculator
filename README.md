# Calculator
This is a simple calculator built out of python.
---------------------------------------------------------------
This is a basic calculator that is made in full python. All functions are defined in Defined.py
Test for this are ran using 3.12.2 and will be updated *Accordingly*

## *SETUP*

Simple to set up. Clone this repository and run main.py. All functions should work automatically, If they do not report the issues [HERE](https://github.com/ram111222/Calculator/issues)
I will respond as soon as I can.
